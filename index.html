        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is what is used to provide a framework for some of your favorite sites. Nothing you see on the web would be there without HTML. This documentation will give you a guide to it. Don't forget to always place !DOCTYPE html and the beginning of every web page like the following.
      </p>
      <code>!DOCTYPE html</code>
      <p>
        My journey of learning HTML has been an arduous one, but it has been well worth it. I wish you the best on your journey as well.

      <p>Fortunately for you reading this, there aren't really any major pre-requisites to learning HTML. This guide will assume that you have a basic knowledge of how the web works and computing practices. It also assumes the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A basic understanding of programming concepts.</li>
        <li>A willingness to learn new concepts.</li>
        <li>The perserverance to not give up.</li>
        <li>An enthuisiastic attitude.</li>
        <li>Incredible focus and dedication.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A quick test would be to see if you can understand what is happening with this code. As a challenge, see if you can figure out how I made those items look that way.</p>
      <code>How do I get this to print this way?</code>
      <code><h1>This is a title font.</h1></code>
      <p>
        It cannot be overstated that you need to always be coding. Practice makes perfect and you cannot fully learn without diligent practice.

      <p>We have already covered what HTML is from a high-level. Another thing that goes hand in hand with HTML is CSS. If you think of HTML as the framework, CSS gives the page some style. Our web pages would be rather boring without some type of style behind them. That is where CSS comes in. An example of CSS is below.</p>
      <code> body {
        text-align: center;
        }
      </code>
      <code>
        p {
        background-color: #eee;
        }
      </code>
      <p>There are different ways to use CSS. You can include it directly into your HTML code, or you can create a separate place for it or a, "stylesheet." This is by far the most common method. It is very easy to neglect CSS, but don't ever forget that a disrespected CSS sheet will create a disrepected website.</p>

        I suggest that the best help one can find is from other's who have been through the same things. I would recommend seeking out a mentor if possible and if not possible, to study dilligently using YouTube and other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        One source that I highly recommend in your coding journey is Danny Thompson. You can find him on Twitter and he actually highly recommended freecodecamp.org

      Some of the further reading you can find is from W3. They will provide you accurate information regarding HTML5 and will also link you to other resources.
    </p>
      <p>
        I would also recommend that you peruse through GitHub and view other people's code to help learn. You will also pick up subtle tips to improve your code.
